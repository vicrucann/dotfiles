## List of bugs

* ~~when doing chsh - command not found~~ (resolved)
* error: path cannot be specified when doing the symbolic links

## Things to do in the future

* include in README: list of necessary and recommended cygwin libs to load, e.g. `chsh`, `git`, `vim`, etc.
* check if `oh-me-zsh` exists and if yes, uninstall it
