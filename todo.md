## List of bugs

* ~~when doing chsh - command not found~~ (resolved for cygwin)
* ~~error: path cannot be specified when doing the symbolic links in `install.sh`~~ (resolved for cygwin)
* `git gutter` colors do not provide good contrast with `solarized` in vim

## Things to do in the future

* ~~include in README: list of necessary and recommended cygwin libs to load, e.g. `chsh`, `git`, `vim`, etc.~~
* ~~check if `oh-my-zsh` exists and if yes, uninstall it~~
* color scheme for mc, and then edit `install.sh` so that to put dot file to `~/.mc/skins`; to select, use `mc -S skinname`
* ~~`chsh` for linux, `passwd` for cygwin - add if-else statements~~
* ~~split `install.sh` into parts and then update `README` to run those parts one after another (for better management of any possible errors)~~
* ~~mc editor: is it possible to change it to vim?~~  
* list of bindings for vim in README
